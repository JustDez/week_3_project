# #Miguel's thought process
# #in chicago, some parking garages have a premium option which is usually the first floor of the parking garage. Then a vip section which is also on the first floor next to an elevator for fast access. 
# #so my thought process is to add 2 child classes (Premuim_Parking and VIP_Parking. Premium will inherit from Parking Garage then VIP_Parking will inherit from Premium. 
# #Also gives me the opportunity to practice more since I struggle with parent->child->grandchild
# #I am also going to try to tell the computer, there are 50 max spaces but in premium there are only 12 spaces and vip will only have 6 spaces. 
# #sorry if I miss our code up LMAO
