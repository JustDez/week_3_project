Coding Temple Week 3 project


Note: The test2.py file contains the final version of the project. 

       main.py is the first iteration


Miguel created the Ticket class and the __init__ and take_ticket methods of the Parking_Garage class

Dez created most remaining methods of the Parking_Garage class. Subsequent garage class make-ups inherit from this class.

Connor added the time module to store when tickets were taken in Parking_Garage and created the Parking_Garage2 class.

Parking_Garage2 inherits from Parking_Garage which Dez did a lot of work on. It fixes some input errors and gives each ticket a unique id with random numbers ending in a random alphebetical character

Miguel then inheritted from Parking_Garage2 to make the Premium_parking class. That includes premium parking tickets which cost 7 cents a minute as oppose to the default 5 cents a minute. The premium tickets can be paid for with the same methods as regular tickets.
